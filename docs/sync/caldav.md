# Add remote calendar from CalDAV

Add any calendar that supports CalDAV over HTTP basic authentication. This has currently been verified to work for [private Apple Calendars](https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/share-a-calendar-mm6b1a9479/icloud). You'll first need to figure out [which CalDAV URLS your calendars use](https://github.com/midnightmonster/icloud-calendar-urls). Then you need to create an [app-specific password](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204397) for this plugin. Armed with that info, you can now add your private Apple Calendars.
